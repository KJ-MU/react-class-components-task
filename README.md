# React Class Components Task - Book Search App

In this task, you'll be transforming a functional component-based Book Search App into its class component counterpart. The app, in its current form, allows users to search for books using the Google Books API.

## Instructions:

1. Implement the following functional components in class component format:
   - `App`: Fetch Book data from the api.
   - `BookSearch`: Search for a certain book.
   - `BooksList`: Display the result of the book search.
   - `BookDetails`: Display detailed information about a selected book.
2. Ensure that all components replicate the functionality of searching and displaying books when converting them into class components.
3. Pay attention to code structure, readability, and maintainability.
4. Feel free to enhance the UI or add extra features for a more comprehensive project.
